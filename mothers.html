            <h2>Why choose Ride for Life?</h2>

            <p>SAFE partnered with Ugandan community members and medical professionals to develop a cost-effective
                solution to the traditional expensive, out-of-the-way, and unreliable transit options to and from health
                clinics: our motorcycle ambulance system. We provided training in defensive and ambulance driving to
                volunteers, who now respond to on-demand pickup requess through our app, which also handles a nominal
                and always transparent fee.</p>

                alt="woman in a motorcycle cartdriving to clinic">

            <h2>Faster healthcare</h2>

            <p>Instead of waiting for a bus that might never come, or walking on foot, you'll be able to call a ride
                on-demand to take you to a verified clinic. That's trading an hour long walk for a 15 minute motorcycle
                ride, each way. Meaning not only more rest for you, but also more tie for you to take care of yourself
                and your family.</p>

                alt="woman nurse taking care of pregnant woman">

            <h2>Quality care</h2>
            <p>We verify each of the clinics before making them availble on the app, so you never have to worry about
                the available equipment, staff availability or even clinician skill level. Our health providers are our
                partners: we provide them with training and also undergo training ourselves to understand the Ugandan
                healthcare market. </p>

            <h2>Experienced drivers</h2>
            <p>In the same way we verify our health clinics, we make sure every boda boda driver who creates a profile
                experiences defensive and ambulance driving training. We also make all driver ratings public, and remove
                drivers if they're rating drops below a certain level or if we receive complaints, though that does not
                happen often. </p>
