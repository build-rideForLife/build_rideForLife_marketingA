# Ride for Life marketing page 

## Website live at: 
https://app.netlify.com/sites/peaceful-poincare-7d74b7/overview 

## Background and purpose 

[SAFE](http://www.safemotherssafebabies.org/) serves mothers in Uganda to improve maternal and child survival. One of the biggest obstacles women face while pregnant is getting to a health facility to safely deliver. Most people do not own a car or a motorcycle, and a majority live greater than 5 km from a health center (an hour by foot). SAFE provides motorcycle ambulances to improve this problem, but mothers have a hard time contacting them in time. 

My Lambda School Build Week team built an app to solve this problem by identifying and sending a text to the nearest motorcycle ambulance driver. My role was to build out a marketing page that raised awareness for the app. You can read our full Project Brief [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0qWOmw0ypnF-0viN9N94EMZqlG3g_OduNoonBzYEK0/edit). 

Feel free to use this code to make your own marketing sites! 

## Tools used 
I styled this site using HTML, CSS including a LESS compiler, and vanilla JavaScript for my components. 

### Primary audiences 
This app contains two user types. A ride requester (pregnant mom, or their caregiver) and a trained motorcycle ambulance drive. I'll assume that these are the two same users who might be visiting the website to learn more about the app. 

### Secondary audiences 
Other visitors to the website could include: SAFE donors, and people with an interest in non-profits focused on Africa or healthcare. 

### Metrics and impact
- Clicks to the 'Login' button that links over to the React app the team is building.
- Clicks to other tabs on the website.  

### Key deliverable 
A multi-page marketing website that explains Ride for Life to prospective riders and drivers and is responsive on both mobile and desktop. 

#### Must have features  
- [x] Mobile, desktop, and tablet responsivity (using media queries)
- [x] Home page
- [x] About us page 
- [x] Links to Ride for Life team app 

#### Nice to have features 
- [] A display that calculates the number of rides that are taken (clicks or another data metric?) in realtime.
