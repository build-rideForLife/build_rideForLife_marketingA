# Ride for Life marketing page 
## Project brief by Kimberlee Johnson 

### Background and purpose 

[SAFE](http://www.safemotherssafebabies.org/) serves mothers in Uganda to improve maternal and child survival. One of the biggest obstacles women face while pregnant is getting to a health facility to safely deliver. Most people do not own a car or a motorcycle, and a majority live greater than 5 km from a health center (an hour by foot). SAFE provides motorcycle ambulances to improve this problem, but mothers have a hard time contacting them in time. 

My Lambda School Build Week team is building an app to solve this problem by identifying and sending a text to the nearest motorcycle ambulance driver. My role is to build out a marketing page that raises awareness for the app. You can read our full Project Brief [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0qWOmw0ypnF-0viN9N94EMZqlG3g_OduNoonBzYEK0/edit). 

### Primary audiences 
This app contains two user types. A ride requester (pregnant mom, or their caregiver) and a trained motorcycle ambulance drive. I'll assume that these are the two same users who might be visiting the website to learn more about the app. 

### Secondary audiences 
Other visitors to the website could include: SAFE donors, and people with an interest in non-profits focused on Africa or healthcare. 

### Metrics and impact
- Clicks to the 'Login' button that links over to the React app the team is building.
- Clicks to other tabs on the website.  

### Key deliverable 
A multi-page marketing website that explains Ride for Life to prospective riders and drivers and is responsive on both mobile and desktop. 

#### Must have content  
- [] Mobile, desktop, and tablet responsivity 
- [] Home page
- [] About us page 
- [] Links to Donate on SAFE website 
- [] Connectivity to the app that the team builds 

#### Lambda rubric 
- [] Pair programming with front end architect
- [] Clean and organized code; a library or framework was researched and used 
- [] Tablet views look professional at +800px 
- [] Responsive units for font-sizing 
- [] Uses .map, .reduce, .filter, .sort
- [] Constructors used to build new objects 
- [] Reusable component built 

#### Nice to have features 
- [] A display that calculates the number of rides that are taken (clicks or another data metric?) in realtime. 

### Project milestones and timeline 
- [x] Sunday, 4/14: Draft design files ready; Ideas for what parts can become components clear
- [x] Monday, 4/15: Marketing landing page scaffolded with common layout structure implemented. Mobile screen width features starting to come into play.
- [] Marketing site including all pages fully responsive to Mobile and Desktop screen widths. Marketing "Login" call to action links user to the Deployed React app login screen.

Really try and describe your project, your project's features and of course have a cool "About Us" page with relevant copy that describes your team members and their roles. All marketing site pages fully responsive and built out, may still need to polish up styling and layout.
